      <p lang="en-US"><strong>PREAMBLE</strong></p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation develops mobile operating systems, applications and tools designed to protect users' privacy.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">As part of this effort, /e/OS is a non-profit operating system project, supported by an international team of experienced entrepreneurs, developers and designers, and a growing community of collaborators.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">But beyond the operating system, applications are also essential elements of a good smartphone experience.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <h1 lang="en-US">PURPOSE</h1>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p lang="en-US">In this context, "App Lounge" is an application that provides access to a set of applications that can then be downloaded and installed on your cell phone (hereafter, "the Software").</p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation is the publisher of App Lounge.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The "users" are the persons who use the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The Software is accessible on the cell phone of users who can use it.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Pursuant to Articles 7(4) and 20 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, the Software allows the User to exercise his rights to the protection of his personal data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Firstly, the Software allows the User to exercise his/her right to download applications without this action being coupled with the collection and processing of his/her personal data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Secondly, the Software allows him to exercise his right to data portability, under his direction and responsibility to download applications from the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">In this context, the User will be able to download the applications of his choice, either anonymously or through his Google account.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">In both cases, the User will have a direct relationship with the Google Play Store, with App Lounge running directly from the User's cell phone, and Foundation will not collect any data in any capacity.</p>
      <ol start="2">
         <li>
            <h1 lang="en-US">VALIDITY AND ACCEPTANCE</h1>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span lang="en-US">The purpose of these Terms of Use is to define the terms and conditions under which Users may access and use the Software. They constitute a contract between E Foundation and the Users. They supersede all previous provisions and, except for specific conditions, constitute the entirety of the rights and obligations of the parties.</span></p>
      <p lang="en-US">By installing App Lounge and using the Software, Users agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and to accept them without reservation.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">If Users refuse to comply with any of the obligations and conditions contained in the Agreement, they must forfeit access to and use of the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Users represent and warrant that they have the legal capacity to contract and, if they are a legal entity, that they are authorized to act on behalf of such entity.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The Users declare that they have the right to use the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Furthermore, Users declare that they have read the Terms and Conditions of the Google Play Store as indicated at: https://play.google.com/</p>
      <p lang="en-US">They also declare to respect them, when exercising their right to benefit from a service that is not coupled with the collection and processing of their personal data, as well as when exercising their right to the portability of their data.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">These General Conditions are concluded for the duration of the use of the Software by the User.</p>
      <ol start="3">
         <li>
            <h1 lang="en-US">SCOPE OF APPLICATION</h1>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p lang="en-US">This agreement governs exclusively the use of the Software by Users.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">App Lounge and the Software are made available to Users free of charge, and without any consideration other than compliance with these Terms of Use.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The relationship between the publishers of the downloaded applications and Users is not governed by this agreement.</p>

            <h1 lang="en-US">OBLIGATIONS OF E FOUNDATION</h1>
         </li>

      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation does not intervene in any way in the management of the applications downloaded via the Software, in their functioning, in the exchanges via or linked to these applications, and in the possible transactions and operations that could result from these applications.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Users are responsible for the circumstances surrounding the operation of the applications they subsequently download via the Software. E Foundation is not responsible for their operation. E Foundation is not their publisher. E Foundation excludes any liability in this respect to the extent permitted by law.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Consequently, E Foundation cannot be held liable for applications, the authors of which are third parties, and any claims should be directed in the first instance to the author of the applications in question.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">The same applies to any Content that is in turn uploaded via such applications.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">As indicated below, E Foundation may be notified of Content that is harmful to a third party in accordance with Article 6 I 5 of the French law no. 2004-575 of 21 June 2004 on trust in the economy.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation undertakes to check the functioning and accessibility of the Software. In this respect, E Foundation reserves the right to temporarily interrupt access to the Software for maintenance purposes.</p>

      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation is not responsible for the use of external software and/or external applications that Users may access through the Software.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">In case Users are redirected to an external application or to an external Software, the terms of use of the relevant Software shall apply instead of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">E Foundation declines all responsibility for any sanctions that may be taken by Google due to the use of personal accounts by Users, and in particular in the event of their banning – ban possibilities being particularly broad with regard to the Terms of Service of the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p lang="en-US">Users acknowledge and accept that it is their responsibility to manage their accounts in that sense, and if needed, to create additional accounts in order for them to use of the Software.</p>
